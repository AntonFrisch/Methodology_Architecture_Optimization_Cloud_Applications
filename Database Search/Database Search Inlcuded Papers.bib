	abstract = {Due to the limited search space in the existing performance optimization approaches at software architectures of cloud applications (SAoCA) level, it is difﬁcult for these methods to obtain the cloud resource usage scheme with optimal cost-performance ratio. Aiming at this problem, this paper ﬁrstly deﬁnes a performance optimization model called CAPOM that can enlarge the search space effectively. Secondly, an efﬁcient differential evolutionary optimization algorithm named MODE4CA is proposed to solve the CAPOM model by deﬁning evolutionary operators with strategy pool and repair mechanism. Further, a method for optimizing performance at SAoCA level, called POM4CA is derived. Finally, two problem instances with different sizes are taken to conduct the experiments for comparing POM4CA with the current representative method under the light and heavy workload. The experimental results show that POM4CA method can obtain better response time and spend less cost of cloud resources.},

	abstract = {As organizations increasingly migrate their applications to the cloud, the optimization of microservices architectures becomes imperative for achieving sustainability goals. Nonetheless, sustainable deployments may increase costs and deteriorate performance, thus the identification of optimal trade-offs among these conflicting requirements is a key objective not easy to achieve. This paper introduces a novel approach to support cloud deployment of microservices architectures by targeting optimal combinations of application performance, deployment costs, and power consumption. By leveraging genetic algorithms, specifically NSGA-II, we automate the generation of alternative architectural deployments. The results demonstrate the potential of our approach through a comprehensive assessment of the Train Ticket case study.},
