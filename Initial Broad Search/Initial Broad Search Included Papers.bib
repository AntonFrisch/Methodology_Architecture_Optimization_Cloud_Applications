	abstract = {Recently we witnessed a deep transformation in the the design, development and management of modern applications, which have grown in scope and size becoming distributed and service-oriented. A big part in this metamorphosis is played by the Cloud with the availability of almost-inﬁnite resources, high availability and outsourced maintenance. This has led to the emergence of new software development methodologies to effectively deal with this paradigm shift in the ﬁeld of software engineering. DevOps is one of them, it advocates for a greater level of collaboration and convergence between developers and other IT professionals. Consequently, new tools, purposely designed to ease this process, are required. In this scenario, we present SPACE4Cloud, a DevOps integrated environment for model-driven design-time quality of service assessment and optimization, and runtime capacity allocation of Cloud applications.},

	abstract = {The rise and adoption of the Cloud computing paradigm had a strong impact on the ICT world in the last few years; this technology has now reached maturity and Cloud providers offer a variety of solutions and services to their customers. However, beside the advantages, Cloud computing introduced new issues and challenges. In particular, the heterogeneity of the Cloud services offered and their relative pricing models makes the identiﬁcation of a deployment solution that minimizes costs and guarantees QoS very complex. Performance assessment of Cloud based application needs for new models and tools to take into consideration the dynamism and multi-tenancy intrinsic of the Cloud environment. The aim of this work is to provide a novel mixed integer linear program (MILP) approach to ﬁnd a minimum cost feasible cloud conﬁguration for a given cloud based application. The feasibility of the solution is considered with respect to some non-functional requirements that are analyzed through multiple performance models with different levels of accuracy. The initial solution is further improved by a local search based procedure. The quality of the initial feasible solution is compared against ﬁrst principle heuristics currently adopted by practitioners and Cloud providers.},

	abstract = {Complex networked applications are assembled by connecting software components distributed across multiple machines. Building and deploying such systems is a challenging problem which requires a signiﬁcant amount of expertise: the system architect must ensure that all component dependencies are satisﬁed, avoid conﬂicting components, and add the right amount of component replicas to account for quality of service and fault-tolerance. In a cloud environment, one also needs to minimize the virtual resources provisioned upfront, to reduce the cost of operation. Once the full architecture is designed, it is necessary to correctly orchestrate the deployment phase, to ensure all components are started and connected in the right order.},

	abstract = {Modern applications are typically implemented as distributed systems comprising several components. Deciding where to deploy which component is a difficult task that today is usually assisted by logical topology recommendations. Choosing inefficient topologies allocates the wrong amount of resources, leads to unnecessary operation costs, or results in poor performance. Testing different topologies to find good solutions takes a lot of time and might delay productive operations. Therefore, this work introduces a software-based deployment topology optimization approach for distributed applications. We use an enhanced performance model generator that extracts models from operational monitoring data of running applications. The extracted model is used to simulate performance metrics (e.g., resource utilization, response times, throughput) and runtime costs of distributed applications. Subsequently, we introduce a deployment topology optimizer, which selects an optimized topology for a specified workload and considers on-premise, cloud, and hybrid topologies. The following three optimization goals are presented in this work: (i) minimum response time for an optimized user experience, (ii) approximate resource utilization around certain peaks, and (iii) minimum cost for running the application. To evaluate the approach, we use the SPECjEnterpriseNEXT industry benchmark as distributed application in an on-premise and in a cloud/on-premise hybrid environment. The evaluation demonstrates the accuracy of the simulation compared to the actual deployment by deploying an optimized topology and comparing measurements with simulation results.},
