	abstract = {Enterprise applications are typically implemented as distributed systems composed of several components. Deciding where to deploy which component is a difﬁcult task that today is usually assisted by logical topology recommendations. Choosing inefﬁcient topologies allocates the wrong amount of resources, leads to unnecessary operation costs, or results in poor performance. Testing different topologies to ﬁnd good solutions takes a lot of time and might delay productive operations. Therefore, this work introduces a software based deployment topology optimization approach for distributed enterprise applications. We use an enhanced performance model generator that extracts models from running applications. The extracted model is used to simulate performance metrics (e.g., resource utilization, response times, throughput) of an enterprise application. Subsequently, we introduce a deployment topology optimizer, which selects an optimized topology for a speciﬁed workload. The following two optimization goals are presented in this work: (i) minimum response time for an optimized user experience and (ii) maximize resource utilization for cost-effective topologies. To evaluate the approach we use the SPECjEnterpriseNEXT industry benchmark as distributed enterprise application. The evaluation demonstrates the accuracy of the simulation compared to the actual deployment and the pre-eminence of the selected topology compared to runner-up topologies.},

	abstract = {One important issue in software engineering is to ﬁnd an eﬀective way to deal with the increasing complexity of software computing system. Modern software applications have evolved in terms of size and scope. Speciﬁc tools have been created to predict the Quality of Service (QoS) at designtime. However, the optimization of an architecture usually has to be done manually, resulting in an arduous and timeconsuming process. For this reason, we present the Palladio Optimization Suite (POS), a collection of complementary plugins realized to run atop Palladio Bench with the aim of automatizing the exploration of the space of possible architectures by means of advanced search paradigms.},

	abstract = {Designing software architectures that exhibit a good tradeoﬀ between multiple quality attributes is hard. Even with a given functional design, many degrees of freedom in the software architecture (e.g. component deployment or server conﬁguration) span a large design space. In current practice, software architects try to ﬁnd good solutions manually, which is time-consuming, can be error-prone and can lead to suboptimal designs. We propose an automated approach guided by architectural tactics to search the design space for good solutions. Our approach applies multi-objective evolutionary optimization to software architectures modelled with the Palladio Component Model. Software architects can then make well-informed trade-oﬀ decisions and choose the best architecture for their situation. To validate our approach, we applied it to the architecture models of two systems, a business reporting system and an industrial control system from ABB. The approach was able to ﬁnd meaningful trade-oﬀs leading to signiﬁcant performance improvements or costs savings. The novel use of tactics decreased the time needed to ﬁnd good solutions by up to 80\% .},

	abstract = {Migrating existing enterprise software to cloud platforms involves the comparison of competing cloud deployment options (CDOs). A CDO comprises a combination of a speciﬁc cloud environment, deployment architecture, and runtime reconﬁguration rules for dynamic resource scaling. Our simulator CDOSim can evaluate CDOs, e.g., regarding response times and costs. However, the design space to be searched for wellsuited solutions is extremely huge. In this paper, we approach this optimization problem with the novel genetic algorithm CDOXplorer. It uses techniques of the search-based software engineering ﬁeld and CDOSim to assess the ﬁtness of CDOs. An experimental evaluation that employs, among others, the cloud environments Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Windows Azure, shows that CDOXplorer can ﬁnd solutions that surpass those of other state-of-the-art techniques by up to 60\%. Our experiment code and data and an implementation of CDOXplorer are available as open source software.},

	abstract = {Modern cloud applications consist of software components deployed on multiple virtual machines. Deploying such applications is error prone and requires detailed system expertise. The deployment optimization problem is about how to configure and deploy applications correctly while at the same time minimizing resource cost on the cloud. This problem is addressed by tools such as Zephyrus, which take a declarative specification of the components and their configuration requirements as input and propose an optimal deployment. This paper presents Zephyrus2, a new tool which addresses deployment optimization by exploiting modern SMT and CP technologies to handle larger and more complex deployment scenarios. Compared to Zephyrus, Zephyrus2 can solve problems involving hundreds of components to be deployed on hundreds of virtual machines in a matter of seconds instead of minutes. This significant speed-up, combined with an improved specification format, enables Zephyrus2 to interactively support on the fly decision making.},
